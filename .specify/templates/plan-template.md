# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Educational Clarity Compliance:**
- [ ] Module runnable within 5 minutes of checkout
- [ ] Performance measurements scripted and reproducible
- [ ] Retail scenarios relatable to enterprise operations
- [ ] Prerequisites documented

**Fair Comparison Compliance:**
- [ ] Identical scenarios for .NET 8 and .NET 10
- [ ] Measurement scripts run both versions under identical conditions
- [ ] Trade-offs explicitly documented
- [ ] Results reproducible on standard hardware (4-core, 8GB RAM)

**Production Patterns Compliance:**
- [ ] Code follows enterprise standards (logging, error handling, health checks)
- [ ] Security practices implemented (no hardcoded secrets, input validation)
- [ ] Performance thresholds met (<100ms p95 latency, cold-start optimized)
- [ ] Realistic data volumes and concurrency

**Incremental Complexity Compliance:**
- [ ] Time allocation documented and realistic
- [ ] Module works independently with isolated setup
- [ ] Complexity progression clear (entry/exit criteria)

**Enterprise Context Compliance:**
- [ ] Business value explicitly stated
- [ ] Large-scale impact documented
- [ ] Cloud cost implications calculated
- [ ] Observability demonstrated
- [ ] Migration guidance provided

**Technical Standards Compliance:**
- [ ] Framework-Dependent (FX) and Native AOT builds where applicable
- [ ] Cross-platform scripts (PowerShell + bash)
- [ ] Performance measurements capture: startup, latency (p50/p95/p99), memory, container size, RPS

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
